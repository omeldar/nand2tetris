# NAND 2 Tetris Project

Welcome to my implementation of the NAND to Tetris project, conducted as part of my studies at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU). This educational journey, inspired by the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, is a hands-on exploration into the building blocks of computing. From a simple NAND gate to a fully operational game of Tetris, this project is a deep dive into the fundamentals of computer science and engineering.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional computer system, starting with a basic NAND gate and culminating in the implementation of the classic Tetris game.

## Structure

- `assembler`: Contains the assembler for translating Hack assembly language into binary code.
- `logisim`: Directory for Logisim circuits used to design and test the various hardware components of the computer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GHC (for running and/or building the haskell ressources)
- Logisim (for circuit simulation)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the prerequisites installed.

### Usage

- To run the assembler: TBD
